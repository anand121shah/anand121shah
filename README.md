## 📝 PROFILE SUMMARY  

Tech professional focused on **ML Operations**, **forecasting pipelines**, and **decision-ready analytics**. I build **modular, scalable ML workflows**—from data ingestion and feature engineering to model evaluation, deployment patterns, and stakeholder-facing dashboards—so teams can trust and operationalize predictions.  

My recent work centers on **time series forecasting**, **revenue/behavior analytics**, and **production-minded practices** (versioning, QA, monitoring metrics, and automation), with strong hands-on execution across **Python, SQL, cloud platforms (Azure/AWS), and Snowflake**.
