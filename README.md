## What I do

- **Machine Learning & MLOps:** evaluation, monitoring, deployment-minded modeling, lifecycle automation  
- **Data Engineering:** pipelines, warehousing patterns, reproducible data workflows  
- **Analytics Products:** KPIs, dashboards, decision-ready insights that don’t fall apart in production  
- **Applied AI Tooling:** useful, maintainable developer experiences (not just demos)

---

## Highlights

- Bias toward **simplicity that ships**: fewer moving parts, clearer behavior, easier maintenance  
- Design for **operability**: observability, versioning, rollback-friendly workflows  
- Strong foundation in **Python + SQL** with practical systems thinking  
- Documentation style: **clean, structured, and human-readable**
